        <h2 id="latest-title">HISTORY</h2>
        <div class="columna1">
            <p class="latest-text">The concept tank was first unveiled at the International Defence Industry Exhibition in Kielce on 2 September 2013, but the project was scrapped in 2015. Despite this, the vehicle has made it into the roster of our game as a medium with unique stealth mechanics, being able to nullify thermal imagers, and thus capable of hiding in plain sight.... Not from infantry tho.</p>

            <p class="latest-text">The primary weapon of the PL-01 is a 105 mm cannon fitted within the unmanned turret, in accordance with NATO standards. The cannon will be able to shoot both conventional projectiles and guided anti-tank missiles. It has an automatic loader for its main cannon, which ensures a fire rate of 6 shots per minute. The vehicle carries 45 rounds, 16 of which are stored within the turret and ready to fire, with the remainder stored within the chassis compartment. The tank is also armed with a 7.62 mm UKM-2000C machine gun with an ammunition supply of 1,000 rounds.</p>

        <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
        <div class="columna2">
            <p class="latest-text">Being based on the swedish CV90 platform makes it vulnerable to man portable AT-Devices, but higly effective to other tanks thanks to its stealth tech. Thus making it an excelent sniper/tank destroyer, just make sure to have some back up from your team, preferably a helicopter.</p>
            <p class="latest-text">Despite the light armour, thanks to its bulky size (in no small part thanks to the stealth tech) adn its unmanned turret, it will be able to survive more shots than most would expect, specially if played in a hull down position. This last bit is true because, for those of you who dont know, unmaned turrets dont recive crew damage when hit, except for high caliber HE, HEAT and plastic rounds. All in all, it will make for a fine addition to ally forces and, togheter with the Ajax IFV, will boost their performance both against heavy armour and light infantry.</p>
