        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The Kikka was designed in preliminary form to use the Tsu-11, a rudimentary motorjet style jet engine that was essentially a ducted fan with an afterburner. Subsequent designs were planned around the Ne-10 (TR-10) centrifugal-flow turbojet, and the Ne-12, which added a four-stage axial compressor to the front of the Ne-10. Tests of this powerplant soon revealed that it would not produce anywhere near the power required to propel the aircraft, and the project was temporarily stalled. It was then decided to produce a new axial flow turbojet based on the German BMW 003.</p>
        <p>Compared to the Me 262, the Kikka airframe was noticeably smaller and more conventional in design, with straight wings (lacking the slight sweepback of the Me 262) and tail surfaces. The triangular fuselage cross section characteristic of the German design was less pronounced, due to smaller fuel tanks. The main landing gear of the Kikka was taken from the A6M Zero and the nose wheel from the tail of a Yokosuka P1Y bomber.</p>
        <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
        <p>A greatly manoeuvrable jet fighter with potent offensive armament and hardpoints for bombs. But careful, as its rather underpowered turbines mean that it will get outrun by all other jets, requiring an experienced pilot to get de best out of it.</p>
