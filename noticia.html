        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The WZ-111 featured a 780 hp (580 kW) supercharged diesel engine and a torsion bar suspension system. The idler wheels were in front with drive sprockets in the rear. Many of the suspension components were the same type used in Soviet heavy tank designs such as the IS-2.</p>
        <p>The first prototype began testing in 1964. This prototype lacked a turret, but was fitted with a steel weight to simulate the actual mass of the turret during testing. Because of many technological problems that surfaced during testing, the design was shelved around 1966. A WZ-111 tank hull is now displayed at the Tank Museum near Beijing.</p>
        <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
        <p>The new chinese heavy tank will enjoy a strong frontal armour scheme thanks to its pike nose design and its thick plating. As for the gun, while powerful, the soviet derived 122 milimiter gun while suffer from a long reload, decreasing its DPM. All in all, this machine will be a welcome addition for the chinese nation.</p>
